# Elev8or Part 1

## Installation
* `yarn` to install dependencies
* `yarn start` to run the app in dev mode

## Instructions
* Get the elevator running! The `Elevator` component needs the current level / floor as a prop, whereas the `ElevatorControls` need a function with which they can set the current level to a specific value. This function needs to be called on clicking the corresponding floor button. Good luck!
